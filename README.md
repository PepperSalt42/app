# PepperSalt
PepperSalt is an Android Tv application developped in Java, mainly during a Hackathon.

## What is it ?
PepperSalt is an Android Tv application which works with slack. It has been designed to make more useful the Android Tvs in entreprises.
With slack commands, you can control your Tvs.

![PepperSalt](https://github.com/PepperSalt42/app/blob/master/github/PepperSalt_sample.png)
On the left side of the screen, a slack channel you chose (by adding bots to it).
At the center an image anyone can upload (most probably HR team to display some events information).
At the bottom a question for your employees. It can be a fancy one as a more interesting one. The aim is to give culture and interaction to the people on the tvs.
On the right, the leaderboard for the people who answered the most questions well.

## How to use
1. [Install the server](https://github.com/PepperSalt42/api) on your own machine.
2. Install the Android-app on your device (Tvs only) by downloading the source code and compile it.
3. Configure the slack bots as described on the server's github (link above).
4. Run the server, run the app.
5. Wait for it !
6. Look at the Tv. No, really. Look at the Tv, it's awesome !

When the app will be ready to share with more people, we will make it available on the Google Play Store.
